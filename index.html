                    I was born and raised in Douglasville, Georgia, in the shadow of the ATL. I’ve been making music and working with computers
                    as long as I can remember. In high school, I took up printmaking as an artform. After financial struggle
                    caused me to have to leave university, screen printing also became a full time job.

                    On weekends, I like to spend time with my friends, make music, and play D&D. I've been an avid tabletop rpg player for most
                    of my life. In what’s left of my free time, I play video games and read. Since before I graduated high
                    school, I have pushed myself to read at least one book a month. I feel that I will have no problem with
                    that goal during class since taking Marta gives me plenty of time to dive into a book.
